Project Name: Campus Connect

Tech Stack: Node.js, Express.js, React.js, MongoDB, JWT Authentication

Overview:
The Campus Connect is a sophisticated web application designed to optimize the management of applications and notices within a university environment. It offers a centralized platform for students, faculty, administrators, deans, and heads of departments (HODs) to submit, review, and process various types of applications and notices.

Key Features:

User Authentication: Utilized JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access the system. User roles, including students, faculty, administrators, deans, and HODs, are defined to regulate access levels.

Application Management:

Hierarchical Forwarding: Implemented a hierarchical forwarding system allowing applications to progress through different stages of review, from initial submission to final approval. Deans and HODs have the authority to view and approve applications within their respective departments.
Role-Based Access: Users are assigned specific roles and permissions, dictating their ability to submit, review, and approve applications based on their position within the university hierarchy.
Comment Viewing: Users can view comments and feedback provided by reviewers, facilitating communication and collaboration throughout the application review process.
Application Status Tracking: Users can track the current status of their applications, including pending, approved, rejected, or withdrawn, providing transparency and accountability.
Notice Management:

Vice Chancellor Approval Workflow: Developed a workflow for the approval and dissemination of notices by the Vice Chancellor, ensuring official communication reaches all stakeholders effectively.
Notification System: Integrated a dynamic notification system to alert users of newly approved notices, enhancing communication and awareness across the university community.
